One of the first security features of SafeCoin was the encryption of the inter-node communications. This was deployed, and now SafeCoin node communication looks like any other encrypted Internet traffic, instead of like Bitcoin traffic. This helps to hide the type of activity taking place, making it less likely that SafeCoin users and nodes are blocked.

For reliability, we want thousands of secure nodes all over the world that users can connect to quickly and easily, and are willing to provide compensation to the node operators. If we have an extensive, distributed, and reliable network, people can use SafeCoin no matter what happens. Secure Nodes enable the security and reliability of the SafeCoin system.
