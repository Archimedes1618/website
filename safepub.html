        <h2>Safecoin currently has the ability in its blockchain with zero knowledge proofs to publish data without fear of censorship.</h2>
        <p>We are looking to expand on this ability and implement a new protocol we call "Decentralized Trust" which will not only allow anonymous publication, but give it purpose and credibility for widescale acceptance.</p>
    <p>Stay tuned here as we work on our implementation of Decentralized Trust</p></div>
