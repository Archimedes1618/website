        <h2>SafeChat is the most secure messaging application on the market and can be used as a standalone product or embedded within our Wallets.</h2>
        <p>Users are able to communicate 1-on-1, through group messaging, or set up dedicated private channels. Channel communication costs a minimal amount of SafeCoin to prevent clutter and spam.</p>
        <p>SafeChat messages are stored permanently in the blockchain to prevent metadata leakage and are encrypted with algorithms such as AES-256 with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), matching current standards of encryption for secure communication. Secure Nodes communication relay is non-traceable.</p>
