        <h2>SafeCoin allows for easy transfer of value by using regular (T) and private (Z) addresses.</h2>
        <p>T addresses are regular addresses and transactions similar to bitcoin.</p>
        <p>Z addresses are called shielded addresses and leverage the latest privacy technology to obscure sender and recipient addresses, as well as amount sent.</p>
        <p>Balances in shielded addresses are private. If spending to one or more shielded addresses, the value stays private but any transparent addresses on the receiving end will deshield the token and reveal the value received on the blockchain.</p>
        <p>SafeCoin is compatible with Bitcoin- and Z-derived applications, exchanges, and wallets.</p>
