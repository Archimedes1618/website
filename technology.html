          <h2>Safe is a privacy platform built on zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) technology with a decentralized SafeNode architecture.  Forked from Komodo, SafeCoin has some of the most advanced privacy technology available, and strives to continually advance through integrations and innovations by our growing, talented and conscientious community.</h2>

          <h2>SafeCoin is the first cryptocurrency capable of zero knowledge transactions with Atomic Swaps, without any ICO or outside interference in our direction.</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to zk-SNARKs, the Safe architecture includes Tor integration capabilities, and will have network strengthening thorough delayed proof of work, which leverages the strength of bitcoin's network. Unlike others, our nodes are completely open source from end to end, including the server.

            <strong>SafeCoin is Money</strong>
          </p>
          <p>SafeCoin allows for easy transfer of value by using regular (T) and private (Z) addresses. </p>
          <p>T addresses are regular addresses and transactions similar to bitcoin.</p>
          <p>Z addresses are called shielded transactions and leverage the latest privacy technology to obscure sender and recipient addresses, as well as amount sent.</p>
          <p>Balances in shielded addresses are private. If spending to one or more shielded addresses, the value stays private but any transparent addresses on the receiving end will deshield the token and reveal the value received on the blockchain.</p>
          <p>SafeCoin is compatible with Bitcoin- and Z-derived applications, exchanges, and wallets.</p>
